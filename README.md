### Welcome to vra7-rest-wrapper

This project is a fork of [vRAAPIClient by chelnak](https://github.com/chelnak/vRAAPIClient), which was originally written for Python 2.

vra7-rest-wrapper is a python 3 wrapper for the vRealize Automation version 7 REST API. It currently supports:

* Catalog Service Consumer API client: Request and view resources

And it currently has partial functionality (this is unchanged from the original fork, but the v6 and v7 REST APIs are fairly similar) for:

* Reservation Service API client: Create and view reservations

Also please check out the official [vRealize Automation REST API Reference](http://pubs.vmware.com/vra-62/index.jsp#com.vmware.vra.restapi.doc/index.html)
